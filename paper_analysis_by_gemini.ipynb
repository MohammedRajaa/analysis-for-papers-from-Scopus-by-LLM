Simulations for a worst-credible-blowout scenario often show that the pumping requirements exceed the capability of a relief-well rig, particularly when in deeper waters and/or where the reservoir is shallow. Installing a Relief Well Injection Spool (RWIS) between the wellhead and the blowout preventer (BOP) on a relief well provides additional inlets for pumping kill mud into the well at the seabed and ensures sufficient flow capacity to perform a high-rate dynamic kill. During the pumping operation, one or more additional high-pressure pumping vessels from remote locations are connected to the RWIS inlets using flex lines. The RWIS system has been validated by hydraulic modeling using the OLGA-WELL-KILL simulator. Two hypothetical case studies, for shallow and deepwater wells, are presented here to show applications of the RWIS and the potential benefits. In both cases, a kill rate of 200 bpm is required at the relief well intersect to stop the uncontrolled flow from a blowout well. For both case studies, the benefit of the RWIS is pronounced and could prevent the need for two relief wells. Relief wells designed to control a deepwater blowout will require long choke and kill (C&K) lines, which could result in significant frictional loss during a dynamic kill with high pump rate. This flow restriction is mitigated by introducing additional inlets at the wellhead.

When captured, the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced from a steam methane reforming (SMR) or partial oxidation (POX) process can be injected into the same natural gas reservoir for enhanced gas recovery (EGR) while simultaneously storing CO2. The objective of this work is the effective integration of these three major processes - blue hydrogen generation, carbon dioxide capture and storage, and enhanced natural gas production. Surface processes include separation of methane from CO2 and other inorganic and organic components in the produced natural gas. Produced CO2 will be injected back into the reservoir, and other components would be managed in ways standard to produced natural gas processing. An SMR or POX process followed by a shift reaction one will generate hydrogen and CO2 followed by separation of the hydrogen and CO2. To avoid a need for post combustion capture, continuous operation can use produced hydrogen to energize the SMR process. Integration of natural gas reservoir production, blue hydrogen generation, and CO2 injection back into the same reservoir leads to a process termed enhanced gas recovery and blue hydrogen (EGRBH). To optimize the reservoir management, analytical and numerical simulation models that address physical mechanisms such as CO2 diffusion, advection, and CO2 solubility in connate water provide guidelines on placement of injection and production wells, on their geometry (vertical or horizontal) and completion interval locations, and on well operating conditions. Displacing methane with CO2 is a miscible process with favorable mobility ratio, and simulations show that the methane recovery factor at CO2 breakthrough depends on both molecular diffusion and dispersivity related to reservoir heterogeneity. Continued production at constant methane rate enables additional blue hydrogen generation while increasing CO2 flow through the reservoir under declining average reservoir pressure. Injection of additional CO2 captured from other stationary point sources can achieve enhanced CO2 storage (ECS) up to a limit pressure less than the original reservoir pressure. The EGRBH process produces blue hydrogen at a price competitive with gasoline or diesel for transportation applications. When used for power generation, blue hydrogen decarbonizes natural gas fired generation at lower cost than can be achieved with post combustion capture from standard natural gas power plants. Blue hydrogen is also less than half the cost of so-called green hydrogen produced via electrolysis using electricity generated with renewable energy. This appears to be an ideal approach for developing and producing new natural gas discoveries.

The FRM technique was applied to a gas-prone reservoir (Cretaceous C-sand interval) of the Lower Goru Formation in the Sawan gas field, Middle Indus Basin, Pakistan. 3D post-stack seismic data and wireline log data of two exploration wells (Sawan-01 and Sawan-08) were utilized in the study. The petrophysical analysis of wells was carried out to initially predict the gas-bearing zones of the reservoir interval at well locations, and later on to predict areas away from the well through seismic to well tie. The amplitude variation with offset (AVO) behavior was analyzed by replacing the in situ fluid saturation level with a modeled 80% gas and 20% water saturation in the reservoir. The elastic properties of the reservoir sand were estimated through rock physics based on Gassmann equations. The AVO response under both in situ and FRM conditions indicated that the reservoir gas sand exhibits a typical class IV signature. The increase of reflection amplitude with angle in FRM synthetic gathers showed AVO sensitivity to changes in fluid type and saturation. The change in reservoir parameters with a change in fluid saturation levels and their AVO response was well-captured in the analysis for effective identification of lithology and fluid concentration in the reservoir. Moreover, the methodology followed in this study will be helpful for better characterizing hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs within the study region and in various other parts of the world. \\u00a9 2020, Oil and Gas Institute \\u2013 National Research Institute.
